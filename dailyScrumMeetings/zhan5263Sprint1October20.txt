What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on crcCards
    - worked on FileHandler (make commands related class easier)
    - worked on CdDIR class and validation of commands in JShell class
    - brainstormed design ideas with team for next work period. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - improve crcCards, CdDIR class, FileHandler
    - change code for "validation of commands" to make it more suitable
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2
        - start and finish Controller, Cat, [Shell]OrderHandler.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need a Controller to execute all the commands and show proper return, will do next period
    - Need Command, History[Number] to be completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working
