What did I work on in the last three days?
    - created CRC cards for the project
    - discussed the implementation of Directory class.
    - initialized Pwd, History, Directory classes
 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - finish Pwd and History

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to discuss on implementation of Directory, File, and Command classes to fully finish Pwd, History, and potentially all of the Command classes.
