What did I work on in the last three days?
    - discussed implementation of JShell/Controller, and how it calls sub commands
    - revised static implementation of methods in Cd, Controller, History,
      Pwd, Ls, and etc.. to non-static
 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - try to put together classes to get Mkdir, Cd, and some simple commands
      into working condition.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - not entirely sure how OrderTable and Controller works; will be
      crucial in putting together the whole program.
