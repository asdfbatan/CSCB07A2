What did I work on in the last three days?
    - tested Cd, Mkdir, Popd, and Pushd within their respective main methods
      to ensure they work before being implemented by Jshell and Controller. 
 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - implement completed commands in Jshell, controller
    - complete the rest of the commands
    - implement exceptions for commands
    - test the program with all commands implemented

Am I blocked on anything?
    - tight on schedule between different course workloads
