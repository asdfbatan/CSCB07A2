What did I work on in the last three days?
    - worked on crcCards
    - worked on FileHandler (more sufficient)
    - brainstormed design ideas for FileController. 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - improve crcCards
    - relate FileHandler to other classes if finished
    - relate "validation of commands" to other classes if finished
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2
        - start and finish Controller, Cat, [Shell]OrderHandler.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need a Directory to finish FileHandler and lots of related classes
    - Need a Controller to execute all the commands and show proper return, will do next period
    - Need Command, History[Number] to be completed (or at least prototyped) before I can continue working
