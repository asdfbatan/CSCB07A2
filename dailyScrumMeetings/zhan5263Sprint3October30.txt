What did I work on in the last three days?
    - finished controller
    - finished cat
    - add showContent method into Directory(to show file content)
    - add handleOrder method into JShell(separate input and pass on)
    - update related crcCards relationships and functions
    - cooperated mkdir, cd, exit with JShell and Controller, now they can be executed.

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - debug above classes
    - continue work on tasks for sprint 2

Am I blocked on anything?
    - not sure what command class is for
    - don't know where to open a file(i.e need a method in directory point to specific file or open file)
