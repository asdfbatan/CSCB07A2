What did I work on in the last three days?
 - Try several ways to create the directory, and decided the best one
 - Discussed and talked to the team about implementation of classes (JShell, Directory)
 - Added more methods into the Directory class.
 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
 - Start coding on JShell.
 - Finish other method, add the abstract methods to meet team mates' demands

Am I blocked on anything?
 - to understand how JShell should work with other classes
