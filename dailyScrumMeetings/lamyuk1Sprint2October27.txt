What did I work on in the last three days?
    - completed the Directory class as discussed
    - completed Pwd
    - implemented Popd
    - implemented Pushd
 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - discuss on implementation of Cd (potentially changing implementation)
    - work on mkdir
    - work on ls

Am I blocked on anything?
    - need to figure out what FileHandler is about, and what Cd has to do with it.
