What did I work on in the last three days?
 - Finished the redirection class, just need to add it to the controller
 - Changed the runCommand of the classes that redirection need so that it returns a string instead of returning nothing.
 - added the crcCard for the redirection class.
 

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
 - add more classes that the redirection class will be collaborating with.
 - need to change the controller so that the controller will give out the right result with the changes of the runCommand method.

Am I blocked on anything?
 - don't know is echo is working and if I should use echo in the redirection class.
