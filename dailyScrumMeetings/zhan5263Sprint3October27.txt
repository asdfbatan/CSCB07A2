What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed for class controller and order handler
    - complete soomething on controller and order table for understanding
    - deleted commands and its crcCards as it's somewhere same as the controller
    - did some rough explanation in controller's crcCard

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - add crcCards and make other cards more clearly.
    - relate what i did to other classes if finished
    - work on tasks for sprint 2
    - delete unrelated classes created by me to avoid confusing

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to have clearly crcCards for what I'm working on to show group members. will do in the following days.
