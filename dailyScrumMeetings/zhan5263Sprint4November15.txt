What did I work on in the last three days?
    - create and complete Find class
    - change and complete Cat class according to requirement
    - change orderHandler, now it separates input into 2 parts(order and parameter)
    - make an example of cooperating Find method with new orderHandle

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Cooperating new orderHandler with other classes

Am I blocked on anything?
    - as orderHandler is changed, other classes need to cooperate with it
    - as orderHandler is changed, controller needs to cooperate with it.
    - too much codes in controller and old orderHandler 
      to separate the inputs for each class, 
      don't know how to cooperate them with new orderHandler
